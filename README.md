# ansible-raspberry-admin

**[Note]**
- xxxx

**[Pre requisite]**
- Raspberry Pi(s) with Raspbian

- Internet connectivity and IP address of the Raspberry Pi (get by scanner something like this : 
	1.sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24)

- Ansible (How to)


## 0 - Prepare Raspberry pi HostName

DO some stuff

## 1  -Install Ansible on Master pi


## A - Share SSH key between remote hosts
First step : Set up a public/private keypair on the Raspberry pi controller so I donâ€™t have to do any login stuff

    // Generate the key
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    // show it
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    
Second step : Copy the key freshly output and use SSH to connect to each Pi from the raspberry pi Master

    ssh-copy-id pi@P1
    ssh-copy-id pi@P2
    ssh-copy-id pi@P3
    ssh-copy-id pi@P4

Not very efficient ...

The best solution

Create a file called 'servers'. One server by line.

    192.168.100.1
    server.example.com
    192.168.100.2
    server2.example.com
    
Create a script file

    #!/bin/bash
    
    for i in `cat servers`;
    do
       ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub pi@$i
    done

## B - Project structure

    ./bootstrap.yml
    ./hosts
    ./keys/
    ./roles/
    
**Description**
    
    **bootstrap.yml** is an Ansible playbook that contains instructions about which roles are run on which hosts, and with which variables.
    
    **hosts** has a list of hosts where the configurations are run into.

    **keys** is a directory for SSH keys for passwordless access to the Raspberries.

   

## 1 - Configuring hosts

## 2 - Configuring ssh access

## 3 - Running script

## 4 - Test the devices modifications
